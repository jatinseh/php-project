          Corals are found across the world’s ocean, in both shallow and
          deep water, but reef-building corals are only found in shallow
          tropical and subtropical waters. This is because the algae found
          in their tissues need light for photosynthesis and they prefer
          water temperatures between 70-85°F (22-29°C).
          <br />
          There are also deep-sea corals that thrive in cold, dark water at
          depths of up to 20,000 feet (6,000 m). Both stony corals and soft
          corals can be found in the deep sea. Deep-sea corals do not have
          the same algae and do not need sunlight or warm water to survive,
          but they also grow very slowly. One place to find them is on
          underwater peaks called seamounts .
