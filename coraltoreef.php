        <h2>Coral growth</h2>
        <p class="lead text-justify">
          Individual coral polyps within a reef are typically very
          smallâ€”usually less than half an inch (or ~1.5 cm) in diameter. The
          largest polyps are found in mushroom corals , which can be more
          than 5 inches across. But because corals are colonial, the size of
          a colony can be much larger: big mounds can be the size of a small
          car, and a single branching colony can cover an entire reef.
          <br />
          Reefs, which are usually made up of many colonies, are much bigger
          still. The largest coral reef is the Great Barrier Reef , which
          spans 1,600 miles (2,600 km) off the east coast of Australia. It
          is so large that it can be seen from space !
          <br />
          Reefs form when corals grow in shallow water close to the shore of
          continents or smaller islands. The majority of coral reefs are
          called fringe reefs because they fringe the coastline of a nearby
          landmass. But when a coral reef grows around a volcanic island
          something interesting occurs. Over millions of years, the volcano
          gradually sinks, as the corals continue to grow, both upward
          towards the surface and out towards the open ocean. Over time, a
          lagoon forms between the corals and the sinking island and a
          barrier reef forms around the lagoon. Eventually, the volcano is
          completely submerged and only the ring of corals remains. This is
          called an atoll.
          <br />
          Waves may eventually pile sand and coral debris on top of the
          growing corals in the atoll, creating a strip of land. Many of the
          Marshall Islands, a system of islands in the Pacific Ocean and
          home to the Marshallese, are atolls. It takes a long time to grow
          a big coral colony or a coral reef, because each coral grows
          slowly. The fastest corals expand at more than 6 inches (15 cm)
          per year, but most grow less than an inch per year. Reefs
          themselves grow even more slowly because after the corals die,
          they break into smaller pieces and become compacted. Individual
          colonies can often live decades to centuries, and some deep-sea
          colonies have lived more than 4000 years . One way we know this is
          because corals lay down annual rings, just as trees do. These
          skeletons can tell us about what conditions were like hundreds or
          thousands of years ago. The Great Barrier Reef as it exists today
          began growing about 20,000 years ago.
