              Coral reefs are the most diverse of all marine ecosystems. They
              teem with life, with perhaps one-quarter of all ocean species
              depending on reefs for food and shelter. This is a remarkable
              statistic when you consider that reefs cover just a tiny fraction
              (less than one percent) of the earth’s surface and less than two
              percent of the ocean bottom. Because they are so diverse, coral
              reefs are often called the rainforests of the sea.
              <br />
              Coral reefs are also very important to people. The value of coral
              reefs has been estimated at 30 billion U.S. dollars and perhaps as
              much as 172 billion U.S. dollars each year, providing food,
              protection of shorelines, jobs based on tourism, and even
              medicines.
              <br />
              Unfortunately, people also pose the greatest threat to coral
              reefs. Overfishing and destructive fishing, pollution, warming,
              changing ocean chemistry, and invasive species are all taking a
              huge toll. In some places, reefs have been entirely destroyed, and
              in many places reefs today are a pale shadow of what they once
              were.

              <p class="lead">
                Corals are related to sea anemones, and they all share the same
                simple structure, the polyp. The polyp is like a tin can open at
                just one end: the open end has a mouth surrounded by a ring of
                tentacles. The tentacles have stinging cells, called
                nematocysts, that allow the coral polyp to capture small
                organisms that swim too close. Inside the body of the polyp are
                digestive and reproductive tissues. Corals differ from sea
                anemones in their production of a mineral skeleton.
                <br />
                Shallow water corals that live in warm water often have another
                source of food, the <strong>zooxanthellae</strong> (pronounced
                zo-o-zan-THELL-ee). These single-celled algae photosynthesize
                and pass some of the food they make from the sun’s energy to
                their hosts, and in exchange the coral animal gives nutrients to
                the algae. It is this relationship that allows shallow water
                corals to grow fast enough to build the enormous structures we
                call reefs. The zooxanthellae also provide much of the green,
                brown, and reddish colors that corals have. The less common
                purple, blue, and mauve colors found in some corals the coral
                makes itself.

              <h2>Coral Diversity</h2>
              <p class="lead">
                In the so-called true stony corals, which compose most tropical
                reefs, each polyp sits in a cup made of calcium carbonate. Stony
                corals are the most important reef builders, but organpipe
                corals, precious red corals, and blue corals also have stony
                skeletons. There are also corals that use more flexible
                materials or tiny stiff rods to build their skeletons—the
                seafans and sea rods, the rubbery soft corals, and the black
                corals.
                <br />
                The family tree of the animals we call corals is complicated,
                and some groups are more closely related to each other than are
                others. All but the fire corals (named for their strong sting)
                are anthozoans, which are divided into two main groups. The
                hexacorals (including the true stony corals and black corals, as
                well as the sea anemones) have smooth tentacles, often in
                multiples of six, and the octocorals (soft corals, seafans,
                organpipe corals and blue corals) have eight tentacles, each of
                which has tiny branches running along the sides. All corals are
                in the phylum Cnidaria, the same as jellyfish.

            <p class="lead text-justify">
              Individual coral polyps within a reef are typically very
              small—usually less than half an inch (or ~1.5 cm) in diameter. The
              largest polyps are found in mushroom corals , which can be more
              than 5 inches across. But because corals are colonial, the size of
              a colony can be much larger: big mounds can be the size of a small
              car, and a single branching colony can cover an entire reef.
              <br />
              Reefs, which are usually made up of many colonies, are much bigger
              still. The largest coral reef is the Great Barrier Reef , which
              spans 1,600 miles (2,600 km) off the east coast of Australia. It
              is so large that it can be seen from space !
              <br />
              Reefs form when corals grow in shallow water close to the shore of
              continents or smaller islands. The majority of coral reefs are
              called fringe reefs because they fringe the coastline of a nearby
              landmass. But when a coral reef grows around a volcanic island
              something interesting occurs. Over millions of years, the volcano
              gradually sinks, as the corals continue to grow, both upward
              towards the surface and out towards the open ocean. Over time, a
              lagoon forms between the corals and the sinking island and a
              barrier reef forms around the lagoon. Eventually, the volcano is
              completely submerged and only the ring of corals remains. This is
              called an atoll.
              <br />
              Waves may eventually pile sand and coral debris on top of the
              growing corals in the atoll, creating a strip of land. Many of the
              Marshall Islands, a system of islands in the Pacific Ocean and
              home to the Marshallese, are atolls. It takes a long time to grow
              a big coral colony or a coral reef, because each coral grows
              slowly. The fastest corals expand at more than 6 inches (15 cm)
              per year, but most grow less than an inch per year. Reefs
              themselves grow even more slowly because after the corals die,
              they break into smaller pieces and become compacted. Individual
              colonies can often live decades to centuries, and some deep-sea
              colonies have lived more than 4000 years . One way we know this is
              because corals lay down annual rings, just as trees do. These
              skeletons can tell us about what conditions were like hundreds or
              thousands of years ago. The Great Barrier Reef as it exists today
              began growing about 20,000 years ago.

              Corals are found across the world’s ocean, in both shallow and
              deep water, but reef-building corals are only found in shallow
              tropical and subtropical waters. This is because the algae found
              in their tissues need light for photosynthesis and they prefer
              water temperatures between 70-85°F (22-29°C).
              <br />
              There are also deep-sea corals that thrive in cold, dark water at
              depths of up to 20,000 feet (6,000 m). Both stony corals and soft
              corals can be found in the deep sea. Deep-sea corals do not have
              the same algae and do not need sunlight or warm water to survive,
              but they also grow very slowly. One place to find them is on
              underwater peaks called seamounts .

              Reefs are the big cities of the sea. They exist because the growth
              of corals matches or exceeds the death of corals – think of it as
              a race between the construction cranes (new coral skeleton) and
              the wrecking balls (the organisms that kill coral and chew their
              skeletons into sand).<br />
              When corals are babies floating in the plankton, they can be eaten
              by many animals. They are less tasty once they settle down and
              secrete a skeleton, but some fish, worms, snails and sea stars
              prey on adult corals. Crown-of-thorns sea stars are particularly
              voracious predators in many parts of the Pacific Ocean. Population
              explosions of these predators can result in a reef being covered
              with tens of thousands of these starfish, with most of the coral
              killed in less than a year.
              <br />
              Corals also have to worry about competitors. They use the same
              nematocysts that catch their food to sting other encroaching
              corals and keep them at bay. Seaweeds are a particularly dangerous
              competitor, as they typically grow much faster than corals and may
              contain nasty chemicals that injure the coral as well.
              <br />
              Corals do not have to only rely on themselves for their defenses
              because mutualisms (beneficial relationships) abound on coral
              reefs. The partnership between corals and their zooxanthellae is
              one of many examples of symbiosis, where different species live
              together and help each other. Some coral colonies have crabs and
              shrimps that live within their branches and defend their home
              against coral predators with their pincers. Parrotfish, in their
              quest to find seaweed, will often bite off chunks of coral and
              will later poop out the digested remains as sand. One kind of goby
              chews up a particularly nasty seaweed, and even benefits by
              becoming more poisonous itself.

              The greatest threats to reefs are rising water temperatures and
              ocean acidification linked to rising carbon dioxide levels. High
              water temperatures cause corals to lose the microscopic algae that
              produce the food corals need—a condition known as
              <strong>coral bleaching</strong>.
              <br />
              Severe or prolonged bleaching can kill coral colonies or leave
              them vulnerable to other threats. Meanwhile, ocean acidification
              means more acidic seawater, which makes it more difficult for
              corals to build their calcium carbonate skeletons. And if
              acidification gets severe enough, it could even break apart the
              existing skeletons that already provide the structure for reefs.
              Scientists predict that by 2085 ocean conditions will be acidic
              enough for corals around the globe to begin to dissolve. For one
              reef in Hawaii this is already a reality.

              Unfortunately, warming and more acid seas are not the only threats
              to coral reefs. Overfishing and overharvesting of corals also
              disrupt reef ecosystems. If care is not taken, boat anchors and
              divers can scar reefs. Invasive species can also threaten coral
              reefs. The lionfish, native to Indo-Pacific waters, has a
              fast-growing population in waters of the Atlantic Ocean. With such
              large numbers the fish could greatly impact coral reef ecosystems
              through consumption of, and competition with, native coral reef
              animals.
              <br />
              Even activities that take place far from reefs can have an impact.
              Runoff from lawns, sewage, cities, and farms feeds algae that can
              overwhelm reefs . Deforestation hastens soil erosion, which clouds
              water—smothering corals.

            <h2>Coral bleaching</h2>

          <div class="col-md-8">
            <p class="lead">
              “Coral bleaching” occurs when coral polyps lose their symbiotic
              algae, the zooxanthellae. Without their zooxanthellae, the living
              tissues are nearly transparent, and you can see right through to
              the stony skeleton, which is white, hence the name coral
              bleaching. Many different kinds of stressors can cause coral
              bleaching – water that is too cold or too hot, too much or too
              little light, or the dilution of seawater by lots of fresh water
              can all cause coral bleaching.
              <br />
              The biggest cause of bleaching today has been rising temperatures
              caused by global warming. Temperatures more than 2 degrees F (or 1
              degree C) above the normal seasonal maximimum can cause bleaching.
              Bleached corals do not die right away, but if temperatures are
              very hot or are too warm for a long time, corals either die from
              starvation or disease. In 1998, 80 percent of the corals in the
              Indian Ocean bleached and 20 percent died.

              There is much that we can do locally to protect coral reefs, by
              making sure there is a healthy fish community and that the water
              surrounding the reefs is clean. Well-protected reefs today
              typically have much healthier coral populations, and are more
              resilient (better able to recover from natural disasters such as
              typhoons and hurricanes).
              <br />
              Fish play important roles on coral reefs, particularly the fish
              that eat seaweeds and keep them from smothering corals, which grow
              more slowly than the seaweeds. Fish also eat the predators of
              corals, such as crown of thorns starfish. Marine protected areas
              (MPAs) are an important tool for keeping reefs healthy.
              <br />
              Large MPAs protect the Great Barrier Reef and the Northwestern
              Hawaiian Islands, for example, and in June 2012, Australia created
              the largest marine reserve network in the world . Smaller ones,
              managed by local communities, have been very successful in
              developing countries.
              <br />
              Clean water is also important. Erosion on land causes rivers to
              dump mud on reefs, smothering and killing corals. Seawater with
              too many nutrients speeds up the growth of seaweeds and increases
              the food for predators of corals when they are developing as
              larvae in the plankton. Clean water depends on careful use of the
              land, avoiding too many fertilizers and erosion caused by
              deforestation and certain construction practices. In the long run,
              however, the future of coral reefs will depend on reducing carbon
              dioxide in the atmosphere, which is increasing rapidly due to
              burning of fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide is both warming the ocean,
              resulting in coral bleaching, and changing the chemistry of the
              ocean, causing ocean acidification. Both making it harder for
              corals to build their skeletons.
